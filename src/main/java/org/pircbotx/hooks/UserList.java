/**
 * This method is called when we receive a user list from the server
 * after joining a channel.
 *  <p>
 * Shortly after joining a channel, the IRC server sends a list of all
 * users in that channel. The PircBotX collects this information and
 * calls this method as soon as it has the full list.
 *  <p>
 * To obtain the nick of each user in the channel, call the getNick()
 * method on each User object in the array.
 *  <p>
 * At a later time, you may call the getUsers method to obtain an
 * up to date list of the users in the channel.
 *  <p>
 * The implementation of this method in the PircBotX abstract class
 * performs no actions and may be overridden as required.
